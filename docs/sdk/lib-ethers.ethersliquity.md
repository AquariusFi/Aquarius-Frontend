## EthersLiquity class

Convenience class that combines multiple interfaces of the library in one object.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
export declare class EthersLiquity implements ReadableEthersLiquity, TransactableLiquity 
```
<b>Implements:</b> [ReadableEthersLiquity](./lib-ethers.readableethersliquity.md)<!-- -->, [TransactableLiquity](./lib-base.transactableliquity.md)

## Remarks

The constructor for this class is marked as internal. Third-party code should not call the constructor directly or create subclasses that extend the `EthersLiquity` class.
